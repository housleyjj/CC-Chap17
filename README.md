# Practicing uploading to github

I am working through Crash Course Python by Eric Matthes
This repository will contain included code provided by the book examples
and my solutions to the 'Try it Yourself' sections.


The reason I am uploading this code is to practice push, pull, fetch, and sync with my local Linux virtual machine.
